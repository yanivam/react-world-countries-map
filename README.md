# react-world-map-lite
react-world-map-lite is a simple, minimal dependencies, react package to draw beautiful maps of world's countries. No need to register somewhere and ask for an access token. No limit of use before free becomes for-pay service. Just like we all need.

## Yet another package for world-maps...but why?

It all started with my a fun project (react-typescript-node.js) that I was building and needed to draw simple yet beautiful world's map. Searching for solutions I found many potential solutions like MapBox and Google Maps, but they were "too smart" for what I needed. They needed to "call home" for the data, they supported tons of options I didn't need, and while they included react-integrations, they were not completely native to the react world. There was definitely something missing. And that's when react-world-map-lite started. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
